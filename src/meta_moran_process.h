         The idea here is that all individuals that are slated to die (according
         to a configurable replacement rate) die at once, and then the population
         expands back to that size.
         
         This model is a reasonable approximation of the eponymous Moran process,
         by Patrick Moran.  The only difference is that we make use of a replacement
         rate, as opposed to replacing a single individual at a time (for speed).
         
         \warning Fitness can not be negative.
